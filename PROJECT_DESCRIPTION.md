## Project Overview

**Student Name(s):** Fatima, [Teammate Name]  
**Course:** Social Computing  
**Institution:** [Your University]  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Project Type:** Team Research Project  

## Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive social computing analysis to examine gender disparities in technology communities through natural digital footprints rather than survey responses. The analysis leverages traces of online engagement from three major tech platforms: Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit, following established social computing methodologies.

## Research Question

**Primary Question:** How do gender disparities manifest in online technology communities when analyzed through traces of natural digital engagement?

**Sub-questions:**
- What are the participation patterns by gender across different tech platforms?
- How do engagement metrics (reputation, activity levels, community recognition) vary by gender?
- What insights can be drawn from analyzing natural digital footprints versus traditional survey methods?
